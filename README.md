in my spring boot application there is a table but there is no column which can hold the time stamp of creation date and we dont have access to nurture the table also, there are old data already created, but we want to show the most recent row created at the top once a user creates a entry it should be shown at top. If we sort based on the primery key also it will not work as in the creation page we have option to provide primery key (ei. id) manually provide me any solution in this case. we cant nurture the table
