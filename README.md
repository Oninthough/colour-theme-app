The DAG defined in the provided code orchestrates a sequence of tasks to process files from a Google Cloud Storage (GCS) bucket. It appears to be a part of a larger data processing system that might be used for something like address verification or data loading processes. Hereâ€™s a breakdown of the code and the flow of the DAG:

Overview of the DAG:
DAG ID: maf_data_loader
Schedule: Runs once (@once)
Start Date: June 27, 2024
Default Arguments:
Retries: 1
Retry Delay: 1 minute
Sends emails on failure and retry to specified email addresses
Tasks:
get_files_from_gcs
process_maf_file (expandable for each file)
finalize
end (EmptyOperator to signal completion)
Task Descriptions:
get_files_from_gcs Task:

Purpose: Retrieves filenames from a GCS bucket that match a specific prefix and end with .parquet. It initializes metadata in a database table and returns the list of files.
Operations Performed:
Creates a GCS client and retrieves a list of files from the specified bucket and prefix.
Filters files to only include those ending with .parquet.
Initializes metadata in a database using initialize_maf_master_table with the number of files, which inserts a record into maf_master_data_run and returns a run ID.
Pushes the number of files and the run ID to XCom for use in subsequent tasks.
process_maf_file Task:

Purpose: Processes each file obtained from get_files_from_gcs.
Operations Performed:
Retrieves the run_id from XCom (set by get_files_from_gcs).
Calls run_java for each file, which involves:
Downloading the file from GCS to a temporary location.
Running a Java program to process the file.
Handling and logging the output and errors from the Java process.
Deleting the temporary file.
finalize Task:

Purpose: Finalizes the processing by updating the master data table based on results from the file processing.
Operations Performed:
Retrieves run_id and num_of_files from XCom.
Calls update_maf_master_table to aggregate results from file processing and update the database accordingly.
end Task:

Purpose: Marks the end of the DAG execution.
DAG Execution Flow:
Start: The DAG is triggered.
get_files_from_gcs: Runs first, retrieves files, initializes database entries, and pushes necessary metadata to XCom.
process_maf_file: For each file retrieved by get_files_from_gcs, this task is executed. It processes the files concurrently, depending on the number of files.
finalize: Executes after all process_maf_file tasks complete. It aggregates results and updates the database.
end: Marks the completion of the DAG.
Key Points in Code:
The DAG utilizes @task decorators to define tasks, which is a feature of Apache Airflow 2.0+ that allows for a more Pythonic definition of tasks within the DAG.
The use of expand in process_maf_file.expand(file_name=file_list) allows dynamic generation of tasks based on the list of files.
The Python functions included make extensive use of the mysql.connector package to interact with a MySQL database for storing and updating run metadata.
Email notifications and error handling are configured in the DAG's default arguments.
Overall, the DAG is designed to handle data processing tasks that involve reading large datasets from GCS, processing them through a Java application, and tracking the processing status and outcomes in a MySQL database. The code structure uses modern Airflow features for dynamic task generation and efficient handling of multiple files.
